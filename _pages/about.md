I received B.Eng. degree in optoelectronic information science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2021.

Presently, I am a Master student at Zhejiang University, co-advised by AR.[Yueting Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenyt) and Prof.[Huajun Feng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0086127). My research focused on dynamic distortion correction of Argumented-Reality-Head-Up-Display(ARHUD) and RGB-EVS joint system deblur. 

Besides, I am looking for a job now!
