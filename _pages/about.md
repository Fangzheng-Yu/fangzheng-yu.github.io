I received B.Eng. degree in optoelectronic information science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2021.

Presently, I am a Master student at Zhejiang University, co-advised by AR.[Yueting Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenyt) and Prof.[Huajun Feng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0086127). My research focused on dynamic distortion correction of Argumented-Reality-Head-Up-Display(ARHUD) and RGB-EVS joint system deblur. 

Besides, I am looking for a job now!

**Research interest:**Optics, Deep learning, low-level Computer Vision.









 Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
